About Me

I am an ambitious B.E. student pursuing a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML), with an expected graduation in 2024. Throughout my academic journey, I have been immersed in the world of AI and ML, undertaking various projects to enhance my skills and knowledge. One of my significant achievements includes building an Image Captioning project utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). This innovative application analyzes images and generates descriptive captions, showcasing the power of deep learning in understanding visual content.

In addition to my expertise in AIML, I am also proficient in web development, specifically in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. Leveraging these skills, I have created captivating and interactive web interfaces, bringing ideas to life on the digital canvas. With a strong foundation in both AI and web development, I possess a unique blend of technical prowess that enables me to tackle complex problems from multiple angles.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to discover a collection of my projects and contributions in the realms of AI, ML, and web development. I am always excited to connect with fellow enthusiasts, researchers, and developers who share a passion for innovation and cutting-edge technology.
